Rummy Agent : Reinforcement Learning

Implemented Reinforcement Learning for Game Rummy using Temporal Difference approach. TD is an unsupervised technique in which the learning agent learns to predict the expected value of a variable occurring at the end of a sequence of states. Reinforcement learning (RL) extends this technique by allowing the learned state-values to guide actions which subsequently change the environment state. TD learning has two approaches namely SARSA and Q learning.
